# BREAST CANCER PDTX

We are actively creating and standardizing a computational pipeline on a highly complex dataset concerning [breast cancer PDTX samples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037319/) as a PharmacoSet object in [PharmacoGx](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PharmacoGx.html). Please head over to the repository [Wiki](https://github.com/bhklab/BreastPDTX/wiki) for a 100% reproducible workflow.
