BREAST CANCER PDTX

We are actively creating and standardizing a computational pipeline on a highly complex dataset concerning [breast cancer PDTX samples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037319/) as a PharmacoSet object in PharmacoGx. Please head over to the repository [Wiki](https://github.com/jenliketen/BREAST_CANCER_PDTX/wiki/SNV-AND-INDEL-DISCOVERY) for a 100% reproducible workflow.
